[DP]
LIS - O(n^2) - DP solution - optimal subproblems found
DP - Base Conditions are very important
can be mostly the vector / matrix traversal bottleneck O(n^2) or O(n) complexity



[Trees]




[Subsequences]





[General Tips]
1. Need to arrive at Optimal solution
2. Clear, Readable, Maintainable code
3. Time need to be taken care of
4. Try to find patterns quickly, generalize don't go deep into test cases
5. Prioritize topics
